# Diffed [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Jun-Dai/diffl.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Jun-Dai/diffl)

This is a library for creating HTML from a unified diff string.  Currently the only use-case I am building is for retrieving diffs from `p4 describe -du 123456` and sending the HTML in an e-mail.  Hopefully I can generalise the problem to add other use-cases.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'diffed'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install diffed
